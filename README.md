# SigCells: Quantifying the statistical significance of cellular segmentation for spatial transcriptomics using selective inference

## Overview

SigCells is the implemention of selective inference to quantify statistical significance for cellular segmentation specifically for spatial transcriptomics data. It accompanies the honours research report submitted with the same title.

## Repository Structure

- `SigCells/`: Main code implementation of selective inference 
- `data/`: Code for data io, simulations and transformations
- `experiments/`: Scripts for testing selective inference
- `figures/`: Code used for generating figures
